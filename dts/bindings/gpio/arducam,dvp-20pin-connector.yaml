  GPIO pins exposed on ArduCam 20-pin header camera connector,
  originally designed to connect Arducam modules to Arduino Giga R1,
  but further used by other vendors of camera and devkits.

  The connector layout is depicted below:

     1   3V3          2   GND
     3   SCL          4   SDA
     5   VS           6   HS
     7   PCLK         8   XCLK
     9   D7           10  D6
     11  D5           12  D4
     13  D3           14  D2
     15  D1           16  D0
     17  PEN          18  PDN
     19  PEN          20  PDN

  In many variants, the last row containing the pins 19 and 20 is
  not present, and the pins 17 and 18 are used for the same purpose
  instead.

  The following node labels can be used for use in shields:

  - dvp_20pin_interface: the video interface that receives the video
    feed and use with the zephyr,camera chosen node.

  - dvp_20pin_ep_in: video endpoint of the devkit receiving the video
    feed (see video-interfaces.yaml).

  - dvp_20pin_ep_out: video endpoint of the camera module to interconnect
    with this endpoint (see video-interfaces.yaml).

  - dvp_20pin_i2c: the I2C device of the devkit on which the camera
    module is instantiated.

  - dvp_20pin_gpio: the gpio nexus using the arducam,dvp-20pin-connector
    that defines the camera 'reset' pin, 'power-down' pin, etc.

  See <zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/dvp-20pin-gpio.h> for pin description.
