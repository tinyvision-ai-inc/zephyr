config USBD_VIDEO_HEADER_SIZE
	int "USB Video payload header size"
	range 2 255
	default 8
	help
	  Sets the size of the video payload header,
	  to allow custom data to be added at the end of the mandatory fields.
	  The default value is arbitrary, made to fit situations where a 64-bit
	  alignment of the payload data is required.

config USBD_VIDEO_MAX_STREAMS
	int "Max number of video output stream per USB Video interface"
	range 1 254
	default 8
	help
	  Each video stream is mapped to a video endpoint on the devicetree.
	  This limits the number of endpoints that can be declared for each
	  UVC instance. The default value is made to be large enough to fit
	  most situations.

config USBD_VIDEO_MAX_FRMIVAL
	int "Max number of video output stream per USB Video interface"
	range 1 255
	default 8
	help
	  Max number of Frame Interval listed on a frame descriptor. The
	  default value is selected arbitrarily to fit most situations without
	  requiring too much RAM.

config USBD_VIDEO_MAX_VS_DESC
	int "Max number of descriptors generated per VideoStreaming interface"
	default 8
	help
	  Sets the maximum number of Format and Frame descriptors that can be
	  generated at runtime per VideoStreaming interface; an array size.
	  This may only need to be increased if you encounter a warning
	  at init time saying there are not enough descriptors available.
	  The default value is selected arbitrarily to fit most situations
	  without requiring too much RAM.
