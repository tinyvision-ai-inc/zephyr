   These samples demonstrate how to use the Pixel processing library of Zephyr.

These samples can be used as starting point for test benches that print an input image,
perform some custom processing, and print the color image back along with the logs directly
on the terminal.

The color rendering of the ``truecolor`` printing functions will be accurate RGB output.

This helps debugging individual functions before integrating it into a larger streams.
