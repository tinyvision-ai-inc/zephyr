Hardware
********
25.4mm x 25.4mm x 4.5mm module, commercial temperature grade: 0°C to 85°C

Connector:
- 2x Hirose high density DF40C 60 pin connectors
- proven on thousands of SoM's in the field in high vibration environments
- Spare pins for future proofing

2 flavors:
- Connectivity: 14 diff pairs, no SSRAM
- Compute: 8 diff pairs, 32 MB [oSPI/HyperRAM](som_memory.md) @ <0.5GBps

I/O interfaces:
- 3x fully programmable clocks
- GPIO, I2C, field updates through FPGA or direct flash programming
- GPIO voltage is programmable

Firmware/RTL:
- uPython for control path on RISCv
- No code, graphical RTL generator with large # of IP blocks (under development)

Development boards:
- devkit for programming/debug
- tinyCamera board as a basis of a compact camera device
- extra adapter boards for various camera connectors and expansion

See the [Pinout](https://tinyclunx33.tinyvision.ai/md_som_pinout.html) section of the documentation.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========
See the [Flash](https://tinyclunx33.tinyvision.ai/md_som_flash.html) section of the documentation.

Debugging
=========
See the multiple "troubleshooting" sections of the documentation, such as
for the [Flash](https://tinyclunx33.tinyvision.ai/md_som_flash.html#autotoc_md29) or
for the [FPGA](https://tinyclunx33.tinyvision.ai/md_som_fpga.html#autotoc_md40).
[JTAG support](https://tinyclunx33.tinyvision.ai/md_som_jtag.html) is on the roadmap.
