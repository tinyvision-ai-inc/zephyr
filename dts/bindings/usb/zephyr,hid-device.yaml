description: Bindings for HID device

compatible: "zephyr,hid-device"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  interface-name:
    type: string
    description: |
      HID device name. When this property is present, a USB device will use it
      as the string descriptor of the interface.

  boot-protocol-code:
    type: string
    description: |
      Device can be used as a Boot Device and supports a predefined protocol
      for mouse or keyboards.
      - none:     Device does not support the boot interface
      - keyboard: Device supports boot interface and keyboard protocol
      - mouse:    Device supports boot interface and mouse protocol
    enum:
      - none
      - keyboard
      - mouse

  in-report-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The size of the longest input report that the HID device can generate.
      This property is used to determine the buffer length used for transfers.

  in-polling-rate:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Input or output type reports polling rate in microseconds. For USB full
      speed this could be clamped to 1ms or 255ms depending on the value.

  out-report-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      The size of the longest output report that the HID device can generate.
      When this property is present, a USB device will use out pipe for output
      reports, otherwise control pipe will be used for output reports.

  out-polling-rate:
    type: int
    description: |
      Output type reports polling rate in microseconds. For USB full
      speed this could be clamped to 1ms or 255ms depending on the value.
      This option is only effective if the out-report-size property is defined.
