  USB Video Class instance

  The Video Class will present a video endpoint to interconnect with any video
  device. It supports multiple endpoints, each becoming its own video streaming
  interface to the host.

  The devices that are connected will receive calls to all query and configure
  the formats, frame intervals, video controls, and get the feed started via
  their video API. Some of this information is used to generate the USB device
  descriptors sent to the host, with the supported format and controls listed.

  Example for single endpoint connected to mipi0:

    uvc0: uvc {
      compatible = "zephyr,uvc-device";
      port {
        uvc0_ep_in: endpoint {
          remote-endpoint-label = "mipi0_ep_out";
        };
      };
    };

  Example for multiple endpoints connected to mipi0 and mipi1:

    uvc0: uvc {
      compatible = "zephyr,uvc-device";
      port {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        uvc0_ep0_in: endpoint@0 {
          reg = <0x0>;
          remote-endpoint-label = "mipi0_ep_out";
        };

        uvc0_ep1_in: endpoint@1 {
          reg = <0x1>;
          remote-endpoint-label = "mipi1_ep_out";
        };
      };
    };

compatible: "zephyr,uvc-device"
